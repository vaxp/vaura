/// @brief State base class — manages mutable state for StatefulWidgets.
///
/// State<T> is the C++20 equivalent of Flutter's State class. It holds
/// the mutable data for a StatefulWidget and provides lifecycle hooks
/// for initialization, updates, and cleanup.
///
/// Key differences from Flutter:
///   - State is not parameterized on Widget type (uses runtime polymorphism).
///   - setState() accepts a lambda that modifies state atomically.
///   - Lifecycle hooks follow C++ RAII patterns.
///
/// Lifecycle:
///   1. `createState()` — called by StatefulWidget, creates the State object.
///   2. `initState()` — called after mount, before the first build.
///   3. `build()` — called to produce the widget subtree.
///   4. `didUpdateWidget()` — called when the parent widget is replaced (same type).
///   5. `didChangeDependencies()` — called when inherited data changes.
///   6. `deactivate()` — called when temporarily removed from the tree.
///   7. `dispose()` — called when permanently removed. Release resources here.
///
/// Usage:
/// @code
///   class CounterState : public vaura::State {
///       int count_ = 0;
///   public:
///       void initState() override {
///           State::initState();
///           // Initialize resources, start animations, etc.
///       }
///
///       WidgetPtr build(BuildContext& ctx) override {
///           return text(std::to_string(count_));
///       }
///
///       void incrementCounter() {
///           setState([this] { count_++; });
///       }
///
///       void dispose() override {
///           // Release resources
///           State::dispose();
///       }
///   };
/// @endcode

/// @brief Base class for mutable state associated with a StatefulWidget.
///
/// State objects are long-lived — they persist across widget rebuilds as
/// long as the element remains in the tree. This is where you store data
/// that changes over time and affects the UI.
///
/// Important rules:
///   - Always call the superclass lifecycle methods when overriding.
///   - Only call `setState()` when the state actually changes.
///   - Never call `setState()` during `build()`.
///   - Release all resources in `dispose()`.
///   - After `dispose()`, the State is defunct — do not access widget/context.
