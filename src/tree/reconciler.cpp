// Global reconciler utilities can be added here.
// Currently, the core O(n) reconciliation algorithm is implemented directly
// inside MultiChildRenderObjectElement::updateChildren (in element.cpp)
// to have direct access to its child list.

// We keep this file for future expansion of diffing utilities,
// global tree validators, or advanced reconciliation strategies.
